 * 
 * This class holds the actor of the Back button. When clicked it finds the stagestart and the number of goalActors, finds them in the stage and hides them.
 * 
 * This is an Actor- meaning it's given texture is displayed on the stage and actions (acts) can be performed.
 * @param texture	The image used for the Actor pulled in from SM_TextureManager (see documentation)
 * @param actorX	The x coordinate of the bottom left corner of the image
 * @param actorY	The y coordinate of the bottom left corner of the image
 * @param started	Boolean used to show if an Actor has been interacted with. Used to stop and start interactions.
 * 
 * setBounds	This is the bounds for the interaction, we make it the whole image.
 * addListener	This adds a listener for a particular interaction in this case touchDown (click)
 * draw			Actor is drawn
 * act			The action taken if the listener detects interaction
 * 				Action- Closes the GoalScreen
