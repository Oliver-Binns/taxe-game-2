<h2 id="what-is-locomotion-commotion-">What is Locomotion Commotion?</h2>
<p>Locomotion Commotion is a PvP turn based train management strategy game. Players complete goals by routing trains across Europe, upgrading and improving their vehicles and buying new stations along the way. From time to time players can collect &#39;special goals&#39; introducing new and often hilarious dynamic to the game. Do you want to deliver the Crown Jewels from the Tower of London to the Italian Mafia in Rome? Do you want to sneak Edward Snowden out of Russia to a boat waiting for him in the south of France? Do you want to save the lives of five hundred Husky dogs by transporting them from Helsinki to Geneva, where they can get the medical attention they desperately need? All of this can be achieved in Locomotion Commotion! </p>
<p>The craziness doesn&#39;t stop there however! Every two turns a new random event will appear causing havoc on the lines. Gorillas might appear in Athens after escaping from the zoo, you&#39;re definitely going to have to avoid moving through there, that could slow your trains down for a long time! However, if another volcano eruption cancels flights everyone is going to want to use the trains, goals might be a lot more lucrative to achieve in north-west Europe now.</p>
<p>Players can even summon the chaos on each other with the use of Wildcards! Is your opponent close to achieving his goal in Budapest? What a shame it would be if someone were to teleport their train to Reykjavik. Are you not going to reach a station before your opponent buys it? A speed boost would sure come in handy right about now. Wildcards let you do all of these things and more, adding new layers of chaos to the game.</p>

<p>Locomotion Commotion was built with maintainability in mind. This Wiki gives guides on how to install the project and all of its dependencies on your machine and how to set it up with Eclipse 4.4. There are also guides for all of the complex parts of the code helping you to understand exactly how the code base is structured and highlighting any pitfalls to watch out for.</p>
